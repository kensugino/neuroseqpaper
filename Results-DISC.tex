\subsection{Gene Categories Contributing to Neuronal Diversity}

(Fig.4B will be moved to the end of the fig., Fig4A will be split into 4A and 4B, the rest will be renamed accordingly.)

Using newly defined DI and SC, we checked what kind of genes have high DI (highly differentially expressed) or high SC (differentially expressed in a robust way). We used PANTHER categorization for gene family definitions. As expected, high DI genes are enriched with neuronal genes such as receptors, ion channels as well as cell adhesion molecules which specifies connectivity between neurons (Fig.4A). Unexpectedly, high SC genes are highly enriched with homeobox genes (Fig.4B). The high SC can be attained by high expression level on ON samples or low noise level on OFF samples. The average expression level of the homeobox is around 30FPKM and much lower than, for example that of 90FPKM of neuropeptide family. Therefore, we inferred that this high SC of homeobox family is attained by low OFF noise. This can be readily seen from the expression pattern (Fig.4C).
