% OUTLINE
% - Fig1. Dataset intro, QC
% - Fig2. Dataset homogeneity NNLS
% - Fig3. "traditional" metrics (MI,CV,ANOVA) vs. DI/SC
% - Fig4. DI/SC analysis, enriched families
% - Fig5. TF Code, Tree
% - Fig6. Long Gene

% TODO

% SINGLE CELL COMPARISON
% - Marker genes by DISC method in SC datasets
% - Heterogeneity of pooled data using marker genes 
% - Heterogeneity by NLS

% ANALYSIS
% - TF family according to cor.coef. class
% - High DI genes according to cor.coef. class
% - Family-wise DI (high-dim Mutual Information & machine learning predictability)
% - Long genes/ Start-sites, Alt-splices contribution (requires isoform quantification, use StringTie)


% FORMATTING
% - fix latex citations
% - fix fig-ref/fig-label
