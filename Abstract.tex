The transcriptional diversity of mammalian neuronal cell types is well documented, but the principles underlying this diversity are poorly understood. We present a new resource of 2.2 Tbp of RNA-seq data from 189 genetically identified cell types, obtained using methods designed to maximize accuracy and precision, relative to those obtained from single cells. Simple new metrics of the information content of genes about cell types, and the noisiness of differential expression reveal that homeobox transcription factors have uniquely low-noise expression and maximal information about cell types. Highly informative effector genes are enriched in long genes. Increased gene length may provide the increased opportunities for gene regulation needed to achieve increased neuronal diversity. Consistent with this view, genome accessibility measurements reveal that long genes have more candidate regulatory elements and these occur in a larger number of distinct patterns across a sample of neuronal cell types.
