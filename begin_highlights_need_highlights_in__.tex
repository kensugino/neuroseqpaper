\begin{highlights}
\begin{itemize}
\item Transcriptional diversity of the mammalian brain revealed by RNAseq profiling 184 cell types.
\item Key transcriptional regulators maintain binary expression pattern through inaccessible chromatin in the off-state.
\item Long genes contribute disproportionately to neuronal diversity due to higher number of regulatory elements.
\item Nervous system complexity correlates with intron length.
