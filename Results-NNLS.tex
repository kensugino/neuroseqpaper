\subsection{Comparison to Single Cell datasets}
A potential problem with profiling pools of sorted neurons is that two distinct types of neurons may be inadvertently profiled together if they are both labelled in the same brain region of the same strain. Single cell (SC) RNA-seq has recently emerged as a viable method for profiling cellular diversity in the nervous system and elsewhere, that does not suffer from this limitation. Profiles of cell types in SC studies are obtained by clustering and then summing cellular profiles. In order to assess the relative cellular homogeneity of our sorted samples we compared their profiles to cluster profiles from SC studies. We focused on neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in the neocortex, since two recent SC were available for making this comparison (Tasic et al. 2015; Zeisel et al. 2015).
