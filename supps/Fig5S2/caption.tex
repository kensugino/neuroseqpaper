\textbf{Homeobox TFs form a combinatorial code}.  
\textbf{(A)} Heatmap showing expression patterns of homeobox TFs with top 30 DEF values. Colors indicate log expression values normalized across rows. \textbf{(B)} DM (differentiation matrix, see Figures 3 and 4C) constructed by allowing cell type pairs to be distinguished on the basis of expression of any homeobox TFs. White indicates distinguishable pairs and black indicates indistinguishable pairs.
