\textbf{Cross validation of NNLS decompositions}
\textbf{(A)} Each neuroSeq cell population is randomly divided into two groups and one is used to decompose the other. Some pairs have similar coefficients, suggesting they are too similar to each other to separate well. For example, pairs of populations identified in layer 2/3 of two different regions in the same strain (AI.L23_glu_P157 / ORBm.L23_glu_P157) or by retrogradely labeling cells in the same layer and region from two different targets (SSp.L23_glu_M1.inj / SSp.L23_glu_S2.inj and SSp.L5_glu_BPn.inj / SSp.L5_glu_IRT.in) are hard to distinguish.\textbf{(B)} Purity scores (similar to Figure 2C) for the cross-validated NNLS decomposition of each Tasic et al. 2016 cluster. \textbf{(C)} Mean purity scores obtained from the same cross-validation procedure applied to each of the three datasets.
