\textbf{OFF noise in single cell datasets}. \textbf{(Left column)} OFF noise calculated as in Figure 4B from the std. dev. of cluster averages, See Methods) against the maximum expression. Red dots are homeobox transcription factors, black dots are all other genes. \textbf{(Middle, Right columns)}. HUGO and PANTHER protein families over-represented in the dashed red boxes in the OFF noise plots (corresponding to OFF noise $<$ 0.2, log2(max expression$+$1 $>$ 4.5). Datasets are from \citep{Zeisel_2015,Tasic_2016,Zeisel_2018,Saunders_2018}
