\textbf{Pan-neuronal genes.} 
Genes expressed in all neuronal GACPs, but not (or at much lower levels) in non-neurons within the dataset. Heat-map shows log expression levels and the color at the right side indicates fold-change of the expression level between neurons and non-neurons. Criteria for extracting these genes are listed in the Methods.
