\textbf{Numbers of candidate regulatory elements increase with gene length}\textbf{(A)}Fraction of gene length attributable to intron
length. \textbf{(B)} Length dependence of peak counts in the ATAC-seq data from the current study. \textbf{(C)-(F)} Length dependence of peak counts in ENCODE DNase hypersensitivity data. Examples from mouse ENCODE data in forebrain (telencephalon) \textbf{(C)} and liver \textbf{(D)} samples showing individual peaks (black dots) and binned averages (red dots) as a function of gene length. Average mouse \textbf{(E)} and human \textbf{(F)} peak counts from brain(blue) and non-brain(green) samples.
