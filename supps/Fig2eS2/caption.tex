\textbf{Random forest decomposition. }
A random forest classifier (500 decision trees) was trained from single cell profiles (column labels) and then used to decompose NeuroSeq cell types (row labels). Coefficients are the ratio of the votes from the 500 trees (coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 and 1 indicates all trees vote for a single class). The pattern of coefficients is similar to that obtained by NNLS (Figure 1 Supplement 3A) suggesting the decomposition is relatively robust and does not reflect a peculiarity of the NNLS algorithm.
