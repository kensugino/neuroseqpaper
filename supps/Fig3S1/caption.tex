\textbf{Homeobox TFs forms a combinatorial code} 
\textbf{(A)} Heatmap showing expression pattern of homeobox TFs with top 30 DI values. \textbf{(B)} DM (differentiation matrix, see Figure 2A) constructed by allowing cell type pairs to be distinguishable by any member of homeobox TFs. White indicates distinguishable pairs and black indicates in-distinguishable pairs.
