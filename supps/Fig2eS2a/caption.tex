\textbf{NNLS decomposition of SC datasets: Tasic by Zeisel}. The same neocortical samples from \citep{Tasic_2018,Zeisel_2018} used in Figure 2 to decompose NeuroSeq neocortical samples were used to decompose each other. See Figure 2 for further details of cell identity. Order of samples listed is as in Figure 2. Presumably because Tasic et al. samples are more finely sub-clustered, individual Zeisel et al. samples (horizontal) frequently map to multiple Tasic samples (vertical).
