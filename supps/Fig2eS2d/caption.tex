\textbf{NNLS decomposition of interneuron datasets}. Data from \citep{Paul_2017}, a third recent single cell study focusing on neocortical interneurons, was used to decompose the cortical interneuron samples from \textbf{A} \citep{Tasic_2018}, \textbf{B}\citep{Zeisel_2018}, \textbf{C} and neuroSeq. In addition, this data set was decomposed using the interneuron samples from the two other single cell data sets.
