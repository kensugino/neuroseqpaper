\textbf{NNLS decomposition of interneuron datasets}. Data from \citep{Paul_2017}, a third recent single cell study focusing on neocortical interneurons, was used to decompose the cortical interneuron samples from NeuroSeq and from \citep{Tasic_2018,Zeisel_2018}, as in the preceding NNLS decompositions.
