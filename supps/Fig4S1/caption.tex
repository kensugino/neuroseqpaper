\textbf{DI length bias in single-cell datasets} DI is plotted against log10(gene length) for four single-cell RNAseq datasets. Red dots represent average DI for genes binned by gene length (500 genes per bin, sorted by length).
% Move to methods: For Tasic et al. 2016 and Zeisel et al. 2015, DI was calculated as described above (LFC>1, q<0.05). For Saunders et al. 2018 and Zeisel et al. 2018, only cluster averages were available, so only LFC>1 was used as criterion for differential expression.
