\textbf{DEF length bias in SC datasets}. DEF is plotted against $\log_{10}$(gene length) for five SC RNAseq datasets from \citep{Zeisel_2015,Tasic_2016,Zeisel_2018,Saunders_2018,Tasic_2018}. Red bars represent average DEF for genes binned by gene length (4 bins per log unit), sorted by length).
% Move to methods: For Tasic et al. 2016 and Zeisel et al. 2015, DI was calculated as described above (LFC>1, q<0.05). For Saunders et al. 2018 and Zeisel et al. 2018, only cluster averages were available, so only LFC>1 was used as criterion for differential expression.
