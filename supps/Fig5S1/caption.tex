\textbf{Gene length and expression properties}\textbf{ (A)} Fraction of longest 500 genes expressed in
neuronal (red bars) and non-neuronal cell types (blue bars) within each brain region pro1led. \textbf{(B)} Distributions of length of gene lengths for low OFF noise genes (Figure 4B red dashed region) and high OFF noise
genes (Figure 4B blue dashed region). Red lines are medians and whiskers indicate 1.5 Inter-quartile
range. (p-values indicated are from Studentâ€™s t-test). \textbf{(C)} Distribution of gene length of genes with top 100 DI and top 100 SC. High SC genes are on average about 5 times shorter.
