\textbf{NNLS decomposition of SC datasets: Zeisel by Tasic}. The same neocortical samples from \citep{Tasic_2018,Zeisel_2018} used in Figure 2 to decompose NeuroSeq neocortical samples were used to decompose each other, but in the reverse order from the preceding supplementary figure. See Figure 2 for further details of cell identity. Order of samples listed is as in Figure 2.
