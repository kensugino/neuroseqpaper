\textbf{NNLS decomposition of Single Cell Datasets: Zeisel by Tasic}. The same neocortical samples from \citep{Tasic_2018,Zeisel_2018} used in Fig. 2 to decompose neuroSeq neocortical samples were used to decompose each other, but in the reverse order from the preceding supplementary figure. See Fig. 2 for further details of cell identity. Order of samples listed is as in Fig. 2.
