\textbf{OFF noise in single cell datasets}. \textbf{(Left column)} OFF noise calculated as in Figure 5B from the standard deviation of cluster averages, plotted against the maximum expression. Red dots are homeobox transcription factors, black dots are all other genes. \textbf{(Middle, Right columns)}. HUGO gene groups and PANTHER protein families over-represented in the dashed red boxes in the OFF noise plots. %(corresponding to OFF noise $<$ 0.2, log2(max expression$+$1 $>$ 4.5). 
Datasets are from \citep{Zeisel_2015,Tasic_2016,Zeisel_2018,Saunders_2018,Tasic_2018}
