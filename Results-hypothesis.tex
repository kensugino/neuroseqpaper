\subsection{Gene length correlates with nervous system complexity}

The above results indicate that gene length is an important contributor to gene expression diversity, which is a key mechanism underlying cellular diversity. In particular we know that distal regulatory elements (such as those examined within introns above) contribute most to cell type specificity in expression ().  Cellular diversity is a hallmark of the nervous system and is also thought to be critical for the complexity of function. Thus gene length and the mechanisms that drive lengthening over time are potential contributors to the evolution of nervous system complexity. This predicts that species with longer genes will have a larger, more diverse set of neuronal cell types, permitting construction of more complex neural circuits. Consistent with this, we find that the distribution of gene lengths for the best annotated species is broadly correlated with nervous system size and complexity (Figure 7A). This is also true of neuronal genes, (defined in the mouse), which also increase in length with increased nervous system complexity (Figure 7A). An example gene illustrating this relationship (the voltage-gated potasium channel Kcnma1 (slo)) is shown in Figure 7B. 

Vertebrate introns are known to have undergone significant expansion through multiple rounds of transposition, and this process is known to have accelerated during mammalian evolution, and more specifically, during primate evolution. Transposons are often species specific, and waves of transposon intertions and subsequent exhaptation are known to have contributed to species specific adaptations, especially in primates, where the events have occurred more recently and so can be traced more easily (). 

To map species-specific genomic insertions potentially contributing to the elongation of human and mouse genes, we analyzed the genomic sequence differences between the closely related primate genomes of human and chimp and the closely related rodent genomes of mouse and rat. We used gorilla as the common ancestor and extracted sequences inserted into human since gorilla. When the histogram of the lengths of the inserted intervals are plotted, two peaks are apparent (Fig.7C). The shorter peak corresponds to Alu insertions and longer peak corresponds to L1 insertions. Overall, 92% of the base pair of the inserted segments overlap with the RepeatMasker [REF] annotated mobile elements. This and analyses from other groups [cite Yanai] indicate that genes are elongated by insertion of the mobile elements during evolution. Since different species have different sets of mobile elements, it is probable that specific set of mobile elements contributed more in elongation of genes.

[The following is not a result but a hypothesis so may need to put into the discussion]

These observations lead to a hypothesis that the elongation of long genes by insertions of mobile elements in germ cells is an efficient way of creating cell type-, and hence, behavioral- diversity which should increase the adaptability of the population. Specific set of mobile elements in human might have been beneficial in accelerated acquisition of complex brain.
