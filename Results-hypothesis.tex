\subsection{Gene length correlates with nervous system complexity}

1) Our results indicate that gene length are important in creating neuronal diversity.
2) We checked gene length differences across species and found that the order matches well to the perceived order of behavioral complexity (intelligence).  (current panel C)
3) Then how long genes are produced during evolution? We compared human/chimp/gorilla and found that mobile elements are responsible for elongation (also cite Yanai) (current panel A). One example of genes which may reflect evolutionary trajectory is shown in current panel B. 
4) These leads to a hypothesis that the elongation of long genes is an efficient way of creating cell type-, and hence, behavioral- diversity and that human might have been benefited from particular set of its mobile element to especially elongate its genes.
