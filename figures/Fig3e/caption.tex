\textbf{Gene expression metrics related to information content and robustness} \textbf{(A)}  \textbf{(B)} Highly significant ANOVA genes (warm colored dots) include a mixture of genes with high SC and low DI and genes with low SC and high DI. \textbf{(C),(D)} PANTHER gene families enriched in the top 1000 SC and top 1000 DI genes. Red lines indicate the p = $10^{-5}$ threshold used to judge significance.
