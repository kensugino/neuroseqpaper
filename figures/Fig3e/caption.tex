\textbf{DEF and FCR capture distinct aspects of expression diversity related to information content and robustness} \textbf{(A)} Highly significant ANOVA genes (warm colored dots) include a mixture of genes with high SC and low DI and genes with low SC and high DI. \textbf{(B)} Expression profiles of two example genes with high FCR (Tfap2c, Hoxa9) and with high DEF (Chrm1, Slc17a6) labeled in A. Sample key as in Fig 1 Supplements 1-3. Red line indicates 0; full vertical scale is 6,6,8,9 tpm (top to bottom) \textbf{(C)} DMs for example genes, calculated as shown in Fig. 3. \textbf{(C),(D)} PANTHER gene families enriched in the top 1000 FCR and top 1000 DEF genes. Red lines indicate the p = $10^{-5}$ threshold used to judge significance.
