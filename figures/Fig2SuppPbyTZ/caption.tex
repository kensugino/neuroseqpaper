\textbf{NNLS decomposition of Single Cell Interneuron Datasets: Paul by Tasic and Zeisel}.
Data from \citep{Paul_2017}, a third recent single cell study of neocortical neurons focusing on interneurons, was decomposed by the interneuron samples from \citep{Tasic_2018,Zeisel_2018}, as in the preceding NNLS decompositions.
