\caption{\textbf{SCRS clusters decomposed by themselves}
\textbf{(A)} Each of Tasic SCRS cluster is halved into two groups and one set is used to decompose the other set. This illustrate that some of the cluster pairs are too similar to each other to separate well. For example, L2 Ngb and L2/3 Ptgs2, L4 Arf5 and L4 Scnn1a, L4 Ctxn3 and L4 Scnn1a, L5 Cdh13 and L5 Tph2 etc. are hard to distinguish. In general, clusters within layers or within certain established interneuron classes are hard to distinguish.
