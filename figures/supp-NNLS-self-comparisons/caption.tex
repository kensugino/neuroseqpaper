\caption{\textbf{Cross validation of NNLS decompositions}
\textbf{(A)} Each \cite{Tasic_2016}, cluster is randomly divided into two groups and one is used to decompose the other. Some cluster pairs share significant coefficients, suggesting they are too similar to each other to separate well. For example, pairs of clusters L2 Ngb and L2/3 Ptgs2, L4 Arf5 and L4 Scnn1a, L4 Ctxn3 and L4 Scnn1a, and L5 Cdh13 and L5 Tph2 are hard to distinguish. This is consistent with the observation of intermediate cells between each of these clusters in the original study (their Figure 4).\textbf{(B)} Purity scores (Figure 2B) for the cross-validated NNLS decomposition of each \cite{Tasic_2016} cluster. \textbf{(C)} Mean purity scores obtained from the same cross-validation procedure applied to each of the three datasets.
