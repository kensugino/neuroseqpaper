\textbf{DEF and FCR capture distinct aspects of expression diversity related to information content and robustness} \textbf{(A)} Highly variable genes (warm colored dots; scale shows significance of ANOVA across cell populations) include both genes with high FCR and low DEF (like Tfap2c and Hoxa9) and genes with lower FCR and high DEF (like Chrm1 and Slc17a6). \textbf{(B)} Expression profiles of example genes labeled in A. Sample key as in Figure 1 Supplements 1-3. Red line indicates 0; full vertical scale is 6,6,8,9 tpm (top to bottom) \textbf{(C)} DMs for example genes, calculated as shown in Figure 3. \textbf{(D),(E)} Hugo gene groups enriched in the top 1000 FCR and top 1000 DEF genes. Red lines indicate the p = $10^{-5}$ threshold used to judge significance.
