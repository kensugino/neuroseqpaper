\textbf{Separability of cell type clusters}
\textbf{(A)} Definition of separability. Distance is measured by 1-corr.coef.
\textbf{(B)} Separabilities between cell type clusters for three datasets with two different dynamic ranges (0-1 for upper row and 0-10 for lower row).  The order of cell type clusters are same as in Figure 2.
