\textbf{Separability of cell type clusters}
\textbf{(A)} Definition of separability. Cartoon represents two different clusters as distributions of points in two dimensions. The separability is the ratio of the distance between the centroids to the sum of the three times the standard deviations of the two distributions. With this definition, points lying 3 s.d. from the mean will be overlapping when the separability is less than 1. The multi-dimensional distance is computed as 1-corr.coef.
\textbf{(B)} Separabilities between cell type clusters for three datasets shown with two different dynamic ranges (color scale; 0-1 for upper row and 0-10 for lower row).  The order of cell type clusters are the same as in Figure 2.
