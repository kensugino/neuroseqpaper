\textbf{TF tree constructed using stronger anatomical constraints}. 
Similar to Figure 5, but the constraints on anatomical boundaries are enforced during each bisection. However, TF expression was not constrained to be uniform within a group, leading to some subgroups that do not match the expression of the dividing gene.
