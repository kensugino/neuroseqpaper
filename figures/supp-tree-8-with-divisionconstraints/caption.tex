\caption{\textbf{TF tree constructed using stronger anatomical constraints}. 
Similar to Figure 2, but the constraints on anatomical boundaries are enforced during each bisection. However, TF expression was not contrained to be uniform within a group leading to some subgroups that do not match the expression of the dividing gene.
