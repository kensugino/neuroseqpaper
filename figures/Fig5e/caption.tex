\textbf{Long genes have a greater capacity for distinguishing cell populations. (A)} DEF as a function of gene length. For violin plots in A, B, E, genes are sorted by length and binned (4 bins per log unit). \textbf{(B)} Robustness of expression difference (FCR) as a function of gene length. \textbf{(C)} Separability of cell types calculated as in Figure 5E, but using long neuronal genes (n=1829 $\geq$100kb) and short neuronal genes (n=10572 $\leq$100kb) rather than functionally defined gene families. Z-score is 33.2 for long and 22.1 for short neuronal genes. Both are highly different from randomly sampled genes (green solid lines mean and Std. dev.; dashed lines = 99\% confidence interval), but long genes provide greater separation. \textbf{(D)} A \textbf{(E)}  \textbf{(F)}
