\textbf{(A)} (Red dots) ratio of number of genes expressed in neurons to number of genes in the population per bin (bin size: 500). (Green dots) same for non-neurons. Histograms show distributions of gene lengths for each population. 
\textbf{(B)} (Cyan dots) ratio of number of genes with nearby NRSE to that of neuronally expressed genes. 
\textbf{(C)} (Magenta dots) ratio of neuronally expressed non-REST target genes to the population.
\textbf{(D)} Variation in expression of long genes (as a percentage of all genes expressed) for different brain regions and cell types. Data are assessed separately for sorted cell samples (Left) and publicly available tissue samples (Right; see Methods.
\textbf{(E)} PANTHER gene families enriched among long and short neuronal genes. 
\textbf{(F)} ??? Genomic distribution of ATAC peaks???
\textbf{(G)- (K)} Length dependence of peak counts in publicly available genome accessibility data.\textbf{(C)}
