\textbf{(A)} Number (histograms) and ratios (dots) of genes expressed in neurons (pink histogram, red dots) and non-neurons (brown histogram, green dots) relative to expression in the entire population (grey histogram) as a function of gene length (ratios computed per bin of 500 genes). 
\textbf{(B)} Number (green histogram) and ratios (green dots) of genes with nearby NRSE relative to the number of neuronally expressed genes (pink histogram). 
\textbf{(C)} (Magenta dots) ratio of neuronally expressed non-REST target genes to the population.
\textbf{(D)} Variation in expression of long genes (as a percentage of all genes expressed) for different brain regions and cell types. Data are assessed separately for sorted cell samples (Left) and publicly available tissue samples (Right; see Methods.
\textbf{(E)} PANTHER gene families enriched among long and short neuronal genes. 
\textbf{(F)} ??? Genomic distribution of ATAC peaks???
\textbf{(G)- (K)} Length dependence of peak counts in publicly available genome accessibility data.\textbf{(C)}
