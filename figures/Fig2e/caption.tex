\textbf{Decomposition by non-negative least squares (NNLS) fitting.}
\textbf{(A)} Diagram illustrating potential sources of heterogeneity at the separation phase in profiles from sorted cells (left) or at the clustering phase in profiles from single cells (right).
\textbf{(B,C)} NNLS coefficients of NeuroSeq cell types by two scRNAseq datasets: \citep{Tasic_2018,Zeisel_2018}.
\textbf{(D)} Mean purity scores for NeuroSeq and SC datasets. The purity score for a sample is defined as the ratio of the highest coefficient to the sum of all coefficients. Error bars are Std. Dev.
