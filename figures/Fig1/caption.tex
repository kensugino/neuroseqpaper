\textbf{The NeuroSeq dataset.}
\textbf{(A)} Schema of pipeline for anatomical and genomic data collection.
\textbf{(B)} Example sections from atlases at low (top), medium (middle) and high (bottom) magnifications.
\textbf{(C)} Web tools available at http://neuroseq.janelia.org
\textbf{(D)} Sensitivity of library preparation measured from ERCC detection across all libraries. The 50\% detection sensitivity of the assay itself was 23 copy*kbp.
