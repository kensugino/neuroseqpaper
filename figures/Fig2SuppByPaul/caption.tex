\textbf{NNLS decomposition of Interneuron Datasets}. Data from \citep{Paul_2017}, a third recent single cell study of neocortical neurons focusing on interneurons, was used to decompose the interneuron samples from neuroSeq and from \citep{Tasic_2018,Zeisel_2018}, as in the preceding NNLS decompositions.
