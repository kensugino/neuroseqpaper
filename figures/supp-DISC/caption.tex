\textbf{High information content genes}
\textbf{A} Normalizing effects of gene length on variance. All DI calculations are made using only expression levels calculated from the truncated 1 kb of the 3' end of the gene (for genes longer than 1 kb) to remove the known influence of length on expression variance. This influence can be seen as a downward slope in the standard deviation with length for full length (left) but not truncated (right) distributions.
\textbf{B} Family-wise, binary DI (see Methods) calculated for each TF family in the HUGO protein family database.
