\textbf{Gene expression metrics related to information content and robustness}
\textbf{(A)} Expression differences between cell types are compiled into a signal ratio matrix (SR) and binarized into a differentiation matrix (DM) reflecting whether each pair of cell types is distinguished (1) or not (0). The Differentiation Index (DI) is the fraction of nonzero values. The noisiness of each contrast (Signal Contrast; SC) is the average expression difference between distinguished pairs divided by the average expression difference between undistinguished pairs. 
\textbf{(B)} Simulated binary (upper) and graded (lower)expression differences between groups (X-axis) with added noise. 
\textbf{(C)} Summary of each metrics' correlation with Mutual Information and SNR: check mark--correlated, X--uncorrelated, triangle--partially correlated.
\textbf{(D)} Highly significant ANOVA genes (warm colored dots) include a mixture of genes with high SC and low DI and genes with low SC and high DI. 
\textbf{(E)} PANTHER gene families enriched in the top 1000 DI and the top 1000 SC genes. Red lines indicate the p=10-5 threshold used to judge significance.
