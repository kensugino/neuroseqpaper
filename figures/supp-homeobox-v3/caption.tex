\textbf{(A)} PANTHER families enriched in the top 1000 bDI genes.
\textbf{(B)} Average binary DI (see Methods) calculated for each TF family in the HUGO protein family database. 
\textbf{(C)} Mean Pearson's corr. coef. between genes within PANTHER families. Homeobox TF family is indicated by the red dot. Most of the PANTHER family genes are decorrelated within families but genes in some families, such as ribosomal protein, histone, tublin, and RNA binding protein have highly significant correlation within families.
