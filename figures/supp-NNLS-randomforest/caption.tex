\textbf{Random forest decomposition. }
A random forest classifier (500 decision trees) was constructed from SCRS single cell cluster profiles and used to decompose NeuroSeq cell types. The pattern of coefficients is similar to that obtained by NNLS (Figure 2A) suggesting the decomposition is relatively robust and does not reflect a peculiarity of the NNLS algorithm.
