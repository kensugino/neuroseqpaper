\caption{\textbf{Decomposition by NNLS.}
\textbf{(A)} NNLS coefficients of NeuroSeq cell types by two single cell datasets.
\textbf{(B)} Mean purity scores for NeuroSeq and single cell datasets. The purity score for a sample is defined as the ratio of the highest coefficient to the sum of all coefficients.
\textbf{(C)} Definition of separability.
\textbf{(D)} Heatmaps showing the separability of the pairs of clusters (for single cell datasets) or cell types (for NeuroSeq). The order of the groups in each matrix are the same as in panel (A). THe upper row color range is such that blue regions indicate pairs that are either touching or overlapping. The same data are plotted using an expanded color scale in the lower row to illustrate the dynamic range of separability in the three studies.
