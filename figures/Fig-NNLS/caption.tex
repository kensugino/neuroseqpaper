\caption{Decomposition by NNLS.
\textbf{(A)} NNLS coefficients of NeuroSeq cell types by two single cell datasets.
\textbf{(B)} Mean purity score for NeuroSeq and single cell datasets. Purity score for a sample is defined as ratio of the highest coefficient divided by the sum of all coefficients.
\textbf{(C)} Definition of separability.
\textbf{(D)} Heatmaps showing the separability of the pairs of clusters (for single cell datasets) or cell types (for NeuroSeq). The order of the groups are the same as panel (A). THe upper row color range is such that blue region indicate that the pairs in that regions are either touching or overlapping. The lower row indicate the difference of the dynamic range of the separability between single cell datasets and NeuroSeq dataset.
