\textbf{Decomposition by NNLS.}
\textbf{(A)} NNLS coefficients of NeuroSeq cell types by two SCRS datasets.
\textbf{(B)} Mean purity scores for NeuroSeq and SCRS datasets. The purity score for a sample is defined as the ratio of the highest coefficient to the sum of all coefficients.
\textbf{(C)} Definition of separability. N1,N2 are number of pooled cell numbers (1 for SCRS datasets). 
\textbf{(D)} Heatmaps showing the separability of each pair of cell types defined by clusters (SCRS datasets) or by replicates (NeuroSeq). The order of the groups in each matrix are the same as in panel (A). The upper row color range is such that blue regions indicate pairs that are either touching or overlapping. The same data are plotted using an expanded color scale in the lower row to illustrate the dynamic range of separability in the three studies. The NeuroSeq data are corrected by the factor sqrt(N)(where N is the number of cells per replicate) to account for the effects of averaging.
