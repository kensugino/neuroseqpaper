\caption{Profiling Genetically and Anatomically Identified Neurons in the Mouse Brain.
\textbf{(A)} Schema of pipeline for anatomical and genomic data collection.
\textbf{(B)} Example sections from atlases at low (top), medium (middle) and high (bottom) magnifications.
\textbf{(C)} Sensitivity of library preparation measured by ERCC detection across all libraries.
\textbf{(D)} Total reads for each of the libraries. Samples are color coded by sample type, region and transmitter, details of which are shown on the right. 
\textbf{(E)} Categories of reads in each library: unmapped: reads that did not map to the mm10 genome including chimeric and back-spliced reads; short: reads less than 30bp in length after removing adaptor sequences; non-unique: reads mapping to multiple locations; abundant: reads containing ribosomal RNA polyA, polyC and phiX sequences, and unique: uniquely mapped reads. Abundant, short and unmapped reads were not used for further analyses.
