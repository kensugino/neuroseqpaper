\textbf{A compact TF code}. A decision tree classifier constructed from the most informative TFs for profiled cell types. Cell types are bisected at each node by TF expression level, (color scale). Each cell type can be specified by the "ON" (warm colors) or "OFF" (cool colors) expression of 4 to 11 TFs indicated. For example, Purkinje cell groups (yellow-light blue group near the right bottom corner, consisting of CUL4,5gr-Cdhr1, CUL4,5pu-Pcp2, etc) has a code: Foxg1(OFF)-Tox2(OFF)-Emx2(OFF)-Hoxb6(OFF)-Mkx(OFF)-Ebf2(ON)-Rreb1(ON) (red dotted line).
