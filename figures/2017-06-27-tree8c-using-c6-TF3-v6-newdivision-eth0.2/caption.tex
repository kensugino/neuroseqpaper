\caption{\textbf{A compact TF code}. A decision tree classifier constructed from the most informative TFs for profiled cell types. Cell types are bisected at each node by TF expression level, (color scale). Each cell type can be specified by the "On" (warm colors) or "Off" (cool colors) expression of 4 to 11 TFs indicated. Cell types are indicated as in Fig.1
