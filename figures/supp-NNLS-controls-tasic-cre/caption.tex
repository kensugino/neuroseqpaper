\textbf{A test of NNLS decomposition. (Left)} Cluster profiles (Tasic et al.) sorted from each of 17 transgenic strains were merged to create one merged cluster per subdissected line (row labels). Merged clusters were then decomposed by the same individual cluster profiles used in Figure 2 (column labels). \textbf{(Right)} The reported proportion of SC profiles obtained from each line subdissection. The close similarity between left and right matrices indicates an accurate NNLS decomposition of the merged clusters.
