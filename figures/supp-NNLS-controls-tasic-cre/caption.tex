\textbf{A test of NNLS decomposition. (Left)} Single cell profiles from \cite{Tasic_2016} were averaged according to the 17 transgenic strains and sub-dissected regions (row labels). Averaged profiles were then decomposed using NNLS by the same individual cluster profiles used in Figure 2 (column labels). \textbf{(Right)} The reported proportion of single cell profiles according to the author's classification. The close similarity between left and right matrices indicates an accurate NNLS decomposition of the merged clusters. This is so since the information about which individual cell types (and how many) were sorted from each line/region was not explicitly provided to the decomposition algorithm, and was available only from the averaged expression profiles.
