\textbf{A test of NNLS decomposition. (Left)} Single cell profiles from \cite{Tasic_2016} were merged according to whic of the 17 transgenic strains and sub-dissected layers they originated from (row labels). Merged profiles were then decomposed using NNLS by the same individual cluster profiles used in Figure 2 (column labels). \textbf{(Right)} The reported proportion of single cell profiles according to the author's classification. The close similarity between left and right matrices indicates an accurate NNLS decomposition of the merged clusters. Note that information about which and how many individual cell types were sorted from each line and region was not explicitly provided to the decomposition algorithm, but were accurately deduced from the merged expression profiles.
