\caption{\textbf{Long genes have a greater capacity for differential expression.}
\textbf{(A)} (Black dots) DI of each gene is plotted against sorted gene length. (Red dots) binned average with bin size of 1000 genes.
\textbf{(B)} (Red dots) ratio of number of genes expressed in neurons to number of genes in the population per bin (bin size: 500). (Green dots) same for non-neurons. Histograms show distributions of gene lengths for each population. 
\textbf{(C)} (Cyan dots) ratio of number of genes with nearby NRSE to that of neuronally expressed genes. 
\textbf{(D)} (Magenta dots) ratio of neuronally expressed non-REST target genes to the population.
\textbf{(E)} Number of patterns of peaks observed in 7 ATAC samples plotted against the gene length
\textbf{(F)} A violin plot showing the relationship between DI and number of peak patterns. 
\textbf{(G)} ATAC-seq peaks for Gabra5 showing different patterns of peak for each cell type. Expression levels in these cell types is shown at right (gray bars)
