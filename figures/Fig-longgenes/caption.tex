\caption{Long genes have higher capacity for differential expression.
\textbf{(A)} (Bloack dots) DI of each gene is plotted against sorted gene length. (Red dots) binned average with bin size of 1000.
\textbf{(B)} (Red dots) ratio of number of genes expressed in neurons to number of genes in the  population in each bin of genes (binsize=500). (Green dots) same for non-neuron. Histogram shows distribution of gene lengths for each population indicated. 
\textbf{(C)} (Cyan dots) ratio of number of genes with nearby NRSE to that of neuronally expressed genes. 
\textbf{(D)} (Magenta dots) ratio of neuronally expressed non-REST target genes to the population.
\textbf{(E)} Number of peak pattern observed in 7 ATAC samples plotted against the gene length
\textbf{(F)} A violoin plot showing the relationship between DI and number of peak patterns. 
\textbf{(G)} ATAC-seq peaks for a gene Gabra5 showing different patterns of peak for each cell type.
