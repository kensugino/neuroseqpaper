\caption{Genes are elongated through evolution.
\textbf{(A)} Histogram of length of segments inserted into human compared to chimpanzee. (See method for details.) The peak at around 200bp corresponds to Alu, and the one at 6000bp corresponds to LINE.
\textbf{(B)} Potassium channel Kcnma1 homolog length differrence across species.
\textbf{(C)} Difference gene length distribution across species.
\textbf{(D)} A model of how neuronal gene elongation contributes to efficient creation of diversity.
