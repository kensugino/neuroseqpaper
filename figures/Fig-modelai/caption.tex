\textbf{Gene elongation across species is correlated with nervous system complexity}.
\textbf{(A)} Difference gene length distribution across species.
\textbf{(B)} Potassium channel Kcnma1 homolog length differrence across species.
\textbf{(C)} Histogram of length of segments inserted into human compared to chimpanzee. (See method for details.) The peak at around 200bp corresponds to Alu, and the one at 6000bp corresponds to LINE.
\textbf{(D)} A model of how neuronal gene elongation contributes to efficient creation of diversity.
