\caption{\textbf{Pan-neuronal genes.} 
Using the "intersection method" used above to identify TFs common to a group, we extracted genes commonly expressed in neurons but not in non-neurons. Heat-map shows log expression levels [TODO add colorbar!] and the color at right side indicates fold-change of the expression level between neurons and non-neurons.
