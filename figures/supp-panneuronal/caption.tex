\caption{Pan-neuronal genes. 
As another example of the application of the "intersection method", we extracted genes commonly expressed in neurons but not in non-neurons. Color in the main part indicate log expression levels [TODO add colorbar!] and the color on right side indicate fold change of the expression level between neuron and non-neuron.
