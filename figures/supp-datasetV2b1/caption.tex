\textbf{(A) Top} Total reads for each of the libraries. Samples are color coded by region and transmitter, as shown in Figure 1 Supplement 1.
\textbf{Bottom} Categories of reads in each library: unmapped: reads that did not map to the mm10 genome including chimeric and back-spliced reads; short: reads less than 30bp in length after removing adaptor sequences; non-unique: reads mapping to multiple locations; abundant: reads containing ribosomal RNA polyA, polyC and phiX sequences, and unique: uniquely mapped reads. Abundant, short and unmapped reads were not used for further analyses.
\textbf{(B)} Contaminating transcripts from non-neuronal cell types. Samples with significant expression of these transcripts (at right)include tissue samples and non-neuronal samples.
