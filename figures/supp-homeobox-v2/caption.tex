\textbf{(A)} PANTHER families enriched in the top 1000 bDI genes.
\textbf{(B)} Average binary DI (see Methods) calculated for each TF family in the HUGO protein family database. 
\textbf{(C)} Percent of pairs of cell types with separability larger than 2 for each of separability matrices calculated using PANTHER families. Homeobox had the highest (95.9\%). Only families with number of members > 100 are shown but the rest had highest of 81.5\% (GABA receptors) and did not affect the rank of homeobox TF family.
\textbf{(D)} Similar to Figure 4E and panel C but using Euclidean metric rather than 1-corr.coef. 
\textbf{(E)} Mutual information computed between expression values and cell types are plotted for PANTHER gene families as a function of the number of reproducibly expressed family members (with maximum expression >=10 FPKM).
