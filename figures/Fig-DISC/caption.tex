\caption{\textbf{Gene families with high information content and high signal contrast.}
\textbf{(A)} PANTHER families enriched in the top 1000 DI and the top 1000 SC genes. 
\textbf{(B)} Mutual information computed between expression values and cell types are plotted for PANTHER gene families as a function of the number of reproducibly expressed family members (with maximum expression >=10 FPKM). (See method for details.)
\textbf{(C)} Examples of homeobox gene Phox2b showing low OFF state noise and non-homeobox gene Plin5 with much noisier expression pattern.
\textbf{(D)} (left) OFF state noise plotted against maximum expression level. OFF state noise is defined as standard deviation of the sample with RPKM$<$1. (right) PANTHER families enriched in the region indicated by red dashed lines in the left panel.
\textbf{(E)} Examples of ATAC-seq read coverages for OFF homeobox gene (Phox2b) and OFF non-homeobox gene (Plin5).
\textbf{(F)} Mean ATAC-seq coverage (reads per million) in gene bodies of OFF-state homeobox genes and length-matched non-homeobox genes are shown. Student's t-test p-value is $<$ 1e-9.
