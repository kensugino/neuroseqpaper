\textbf{(A)Top} Total reads for each of the libraries. Samples are color coded by region and transmitter, as indicated in Figure 1 Supplement 1.
\textbf{Bottom}Categories of reads in each library: unmapped: reads that did not map to the mm10 genome including chimeric and back-spliced reads; short: reads less than 30bp in length after removing adaptor sequences; non-unique: reads mapping to multiple locations; abundant: reads containing ribosomal RNA polyA, polyC and phiX sequences, and unique: uniquely mapped reads. Abundant, short and unmapped reads were not used for further analyses. 
\textbf{(B)}Contamination from other cell types. Heatmap shows relative abundance of transcripts associated with non-neuronal cell types in neuronal and non-neuronal samples.
