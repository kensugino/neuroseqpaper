\caption{\textbf{DI and MI are highly correlated}}
Relationship between DI, calculated without considering replicates, and MI with expression levels discretized into 2 levels (left) and 5 levels (right). Although increasing the number of discrete expression levels spreads the relationship, they remain monotonically and closely related.
