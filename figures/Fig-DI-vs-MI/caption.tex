\textbf{DI and MI are highly correlated}
Relationship between DI, calculated without considering replicates (see Methods), and MI with expression levels discretized into 2 levels (left) and 5 levels (right). Although increasing the number of discrete expression levels decreases the degree of correlation, they remain monotonically and closely related.
