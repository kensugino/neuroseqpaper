\textbf{Features of DI for expression and splicing}

\textbf{(A)} (Upper) An example of simulated binary and graded expression patterns with added noise. X-axis indicates sample/groups. (Lower) Various average metrics calculated from the simulated expression patterns (100 individual simulations; error bars are standard deviations). Values are normalized within each metric across binary expression group or graded expression group. 
\textbf{(B)} Summary of each metric's correlation with Mutual Information and SNR: check mark--correlated, X--uncorrelated, triangle--partially correlated.
\textbf{(C) DI and MI are highly correlated.} The relationship between DI, calculated without considering replicates%(q-value part was dropped)\%
, and MI with expression levels discretized into 2 levels (left) and 5 levels (right). Although increasing the number of discrete expression levels decreases the degree of correlation, they remain monotonically and closely related.
