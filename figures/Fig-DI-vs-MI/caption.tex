\textbf{(A)} DI and MI are highly correlated. Relationship between DI, calculated without considering replicates (see Methods), and MI with expression levels discretized into 2 levels (left) and 5 levels (right). Although increasing the number of discrete expression levels decreases the degree of correlation, they remain monotonically and closely related.
\textbf {(B)} Normalizing effects of gene length on variance. All DI calculations are made using only expression levels calculated from the truncated 1 kb of the 3' end of the gene (for genes longer than 1 kb) to remove the known influence of length on expression variance. This influence can be seen as a downward slope in the standard deviation with length for full length (left) but not truncated (right) distributions.
