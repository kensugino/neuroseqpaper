\textbf{Decomposition by non-negative least squares (NNLS) fitting.}
\textbf{(A)} NNLS coefficients of NeuroSeq cell types by two single cell RNAseq datasets: \citep{Zeisel_2015,Tasic_2016}.
\textbf{(B)} (Left) Tasic et al. clusters decomposed by Zeisel et al. clusters. (Right) Zeisel et al. clusters decomposed by Tasic et al. clusters. There are few perfect matches.
\textbf{(C)} Mean purity scores for NeuroSeq and single cell datasets. The purity score for a sample is defined as the ratio of the highest coefficient to the sum of all coefficients. (**:p$<$0.01, t-test.)
